# Simple Deep Learning Consensus Sample

This sample shows how to setup a simple deep learning based pipeline
to learn and predict consensus sequence from reads.

For this sample, the following are necessary for each consensus region - 

1. Draft backbone.
2. Supporting reads.
2. Truth sequence.

## Third party software dependencies

The pre-processing of files done in this sample depend on several third-party
softwares. Please make sure you have them available in your environment in the
`$PATH` variable before continuing with this sample.

1. `minimap2` >= 2.17
2. `samtools` >= 1.10

## Data Generation

First step of this sample is to generate the encodings and labels used in training and evaluation.

The `pileup_hdf5_generator.py` script implements a data preparation script that leverages the
`SummaryEncoder` and `HaploidLabelEncoder` from VariantWorks to compute the feature and
label encodings, respectively. Generated encodings are then serialize into an HDF5 dataset.
This kind of pre-training data generation is common practice in neural network pipelines as
it yields more efficient usage of the GPU and overall better runtime performance.

The `pileup_hdf5_generator.py` expects data to be organized in the following way for each sample -
```
-> example_folder
---> draft.fa
---> truth.fa
---> subreads.fa
```

The following is a sample command line for running the script.
```
python pileup_hdf5_generator.py -r `pwd`/data/samples/1 -o train.hdf -t 4
python pileup_hdf5_generator.py -r `pwd`/data/samples/2 -o eval.hdf -t 4
```

The `pileup_hdf5_generator.py` also has a `-d` option which can accept a folder with multiple
data examples underneath it, i.e. a folder of folders each of which is in the format described
above. This is added as a utility to enable processing of larger datasets.

For more details on the script usage, please refer to its help message.
```
python pileup_hdf5_generator.py -h
```

## Training pipeline

Once the dataset has been generated, the next step is to plug them into the trainer.

The trainer is a deep learning training and evaluation pipeline configured using the
[NeMo](https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo/) API. The key VariantWorks components highlighted in
the trainer are the `HDFDataLoader` class (from `variantworks.dataloader`) that serves samples
and labels to the network during training and evaluation, and a reference RNN network architecture
, `ConsensusRNN`, suitable for consensus calling (from `variantworks.networks`).

The following is a sample command line for the trainer.
```
python rnn_consensus_trainer.py --train-hdf train.hdf --epochs 50 --model-dir `pwd`/sample_models --eval-hdf eval.hdf
```

Details of the script usage can be found in its help message.
```
python rnn_consensus_trainer.py -h
```

## Inference pipeline

The inference script takes care of running a pre-trained model on unseen data, post-processesing
the model output into a genomic sequence, and writing the sequence out to a `fasta` file. For each of
these steps, the inference script uses componets from the VariantWorks API such as the `HDFDataLoader`,
the reference network architecture and the concatenation utility for merging model outputs into
the final consensus sequence.

The current inference script is setup to only processes a single consensus sequence at a time,
i.e. the hdf file passed to it must contain encodings from a single underlying sequence. If multiple
sequence encodings are present, the script may concatenate them into a single incorrect sequence.

Here's a sample command line for the inference script using a pre-trained model.
```
python pileup_hdf5_generator.py -r `pwd`/data/samples/3 -o infer.hdf
python rnn_consensus_infer.py --infer-hdf infer.hdf --model-dir `pwd`/sample_models -o sample.fasta
```
